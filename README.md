## Binary Toddler Countdown Machine

My son is a master negotiator, especially around bed time. He always asks for "3 more minutes" to keep playing. I will use this as a timer to keep him to that (with a side effect of getting him familiar with binary counting). The LEDs light one after the other in a binary pattern with 3 seconds delays. When the `63 x 3` seconds are reached (maximum count based on the 6 LEDs I have in the kit), they all start flashing.

Short-term Todo:

* Make it a countdown (start with all bulbs lit and work down to no lights)
